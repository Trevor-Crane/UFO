# UFO

## Overview of Anaysis
Our client has been interested in UFO's since she was a child. As such, she wants to build a webpage that has shown UFO citings, and let you make the call. With only a JavaScript file of reported instances, it is our job to help her visualize her dreams.

## Results
Although it is only available on a local server, we have created the website our client wanted. Thanks to the JavaScript file we started out with, we have a webpage that has data for each reported incident, which includes the date of incident, city of incident, state of incident, country of incident, the shape the incident was, how long it lasted, and comments describing the incident. However, there is a lot of data involved in this, so to make it easier for both our client, and possible future onlookers, we included a filter search to help narrow down possible results that they are interested in. They can filter to either the date, city, state country, or shape to aid in their search. Below is an example of what it looks like just entering a page:

To help narrow the search, they can narrow it to any of the filters we provided. I included the filter with the state of Oregon as an example:

![Search_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/187806155-8a718d43-4dd5-42b0-9887-5def6f1320b2.png)

This has narrowed our search quite significantly. However, it doesn't stop there. We can continue our filters even mroe than this. For instance, if we wanted to do Grants Pass in Oregon, we get the following:

![Search-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/187806285-34be209a-43ea-4500-b00f-fd669dc70810.png)

With these filters accessible, finding exactly what they went is as simple as a few simple clicks.

## Summary
Although this website is good for what it does, there is still much room for improvement. 

### Drawback
When it comes to most filters online, there generally is a button you can select to initiate the search. However, in this case, we have to click enter before anything happens. Unfortunately, it doesn't state anywhere you need to click enter to start the search, so for some, it could lead to confusion. Also, this filter is case sensitive. So, if you want to search for a proper city, you need to make sure it isn't capitalized in the front, otherwise the filter won't recognize it.

### Recommendations
This search functionality is far from perfect. One way to improve it is to possibly have a drop down menu for possible filter options instead of having the user input something. That way, if what they are searching for isn't there, they can see it before entering the filter. Another option for improvement is adding a button functionality to let the system know when to start narrowing their search. It is a little more intuitive that way for the users.
